# GitHub Workflow Summary

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

I've created a complete GitHub Actions workflow for automated building, signing, and releasing of WhatsTap2.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`** - Main workflow file
2. **`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
3. **`encode_keystore_for_github.sh`** - Helper script to encode keystore for secrets

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Secrets (One Time)
```bash
# Generate keystore if you haven't already
./generate_keystore.sh

# Encode keystore for GitHub
./encode_keystore_for_github.sh
```

Then add the 4 secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` 
- `KEY_ALIAS`
- `KEY_PASSWORD`

### 2. Create Releases
```bash
# Tag and push for automatic release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
